/* 
DESCRIPTION: This file contains the logic for computing points based on weekly water consumption. It accepts consumption data for a single corridor
in the form of a sorted array in descending order containing the historical daily consumption data for the corridor.
The function calculates score based on the following Logic:
1. Corridors can achieve score based on either an improvement in water usage is decreasing or proximity to a predefined "sustainable" level of water usage.
2. The trend score is calculated based on comparing moving averages over 7 and 30 days.
3. The proximity score is calculated based on the average water usage over the last 7 days compared to the baseline

UNCERTAINTIES: 
1. Assumption about difficulty of lowering water consumption: Right now, a 15% drop gives full points, which 
   might be very hard or very easy depending on the corrior's habits, time of year and variance in daily usage.
   Therefore, the improvement score tiers are stored in a config array, so non-devs can tweak them without code changes. 
2. Right now, corridors only get max points for proximity if they are exactly at the "sutainable" level, which might be a bit harsh.
